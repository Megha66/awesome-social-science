The "Walkiing Corpse Syndrome" or Cotard's Delusion

People with Cotard’s syndrome believe that they have either died or been mutilated in some improbable manner such as having all of their
blood drained or their organs removed. Yet other patients show delusions of immortality..
The condition is most common among schizophrenics and people who’ve suffered head trauma. In one famous case,a young man who hit his head 
in a motorcycle accident in Scotland left the hospital convinced he was dead from either septicemia or AIDS. Shortly afterward, when his 
mother took him to South Africa, he came to believe that his soul had been sent to hell.
